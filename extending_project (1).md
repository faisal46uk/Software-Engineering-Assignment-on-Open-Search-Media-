# Documentation for Reuse and Extension

This repository is designed for reusability and future enhancements. Code and components are well-structured and documented.

## Structure

- **React Frontend**: Separated by components, easy to update or replace.
- **Node.js Backend**: RESTful routes with Express, scalable for new APIs.
- **Database Models**: SQL Server models support expansion like new user roles, filters, etc.

## How to Extend

- Add OAuth login support in backend and update login UI.
- Integrate a media upload module.
- Extend to handle video and audio using Openverse media_type filters.
- Improve UI responsiveness and search filtering.

## Developer Notes

- Follow modular practices.
- Document new APIs and endpoints in `/docs`.
- Use `.env.example` for environment replication.

## Deployment

Use Docker and Docker Compose for scalable deployment across environments.

This setup allows seamless collaboration, version control, and expansion of features.
